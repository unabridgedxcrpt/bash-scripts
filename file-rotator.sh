# FILE ROTATOR SCRIPT
#
# The purpose of this script is to rotate, compress and delete files
# - Files older than ARC_AGE are gzipped and rotated
# - Files bigger than SIZE_LIM are gzipped and rotated
# - Gzipped files older than DEL_AGE are deleted
# This script is hard-coded to work on specific directory, age, and file size limit
#
